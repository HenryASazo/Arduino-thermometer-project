# Arduino Project: Thermometer

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Arduino project I developed during my university studies. It showcases my understanding of microcontrollers, electronic components, and programming in C/C++.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: [Briefly describe the purpose, e.g., "To build an interactive system that monitors temperature, controls components, and responds to user input."]  
**Hardware Used**:

- Arduino Uno
- LEDs
- LCD screen
- Buzzer
- Servo motor
- Rotary encoders
- Push buttons
- DS18B20 temperature sensor

**Software**:

- VS Code

## Features

- **Temperature Monitoring**: Uses the DS18B20 sensor to measure and display temperature on an LCD.
- **Interactive Controls**: Incorporates buttons and encoders for user inputs.
- **Alerts**: Triggers buzzers for alarms or notifications based on specific conditions.
- **Actuator Control**: Operates a servo motor to display the temperature on it.
- **LED Indicators**: Uses LEDs for status signaling or visual effects.

## How It Works

The project combines various hardware components to create an interactive system:

1. The DS18B20 sensor measures temperature and sends data to the Arduino.
2. Temperature data is displayed on an LCD screen in real time.
3. Buttons and encoders allow user interaction, such as adjusting thresholds or triggering actions.
4. LEDs and a buzzer provide visual and audible feedback based on specific conditions.
5. The servo motor responds to programmed triggers, performing precise mechanical tasks.

## Learning Outcomes

This project helped me develop skills in:

- Integrating and controlling multiple components with Arduino.
- Writing structured, efficient, and modular code.
- Designing and debugging electronic circuits.

## Future Improvements

- Add Wi-Fi or Bluetooth functionality for remote monitoring and control.
- Enhance user interface with a touch screen or mobile app integration.
- Implement data logging for long-term temperature monitoring.
