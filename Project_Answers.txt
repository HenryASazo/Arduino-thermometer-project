				  Thermometer


Review Question 1 (Cost Analysis):

Assume we are building 1000 units of this system.  Use the provided part
numbers (see the webpage) and the digikey.com or jameco.com website to find the
total **cost per unit** (again assume we build a quantity of 1000 units) for
these thermometers.  Itemize the part costs (list each part and its
unit cost when bought in units of 1000) and then show the final cost per unit
below.  Note: You only need to price the components used in the project (not
all the components in your lab kit.  Also, you do not need to account for the
cost of the circuit board or wires. In a real environment we would manufacture
a PCB (Printed Circuit Board). As an optional task, you can search online for
PCB manufacturers and what the costs and options are in creating a PCB.

Parts                Quantity             Cost for one       Total amount for Project Requirment

temperature sensor      1                   $4.22                               $4.22
LCD                     1                   $9.90                               $9.90
Push Buttons            2                   $1.44                                $2.88
330 Ohm resistor        2                   $0.011                              $0.022
4.7kOhm resistor        1                   $0.011                              $0.011
Buzzer                  1                   $0.473                              $0.473
Rotary Encoder          1                   $1.683                              $1.683
Red LED                 1                   $0.104                              $0.104
Green LED               1                   $0.104                              $0.104

The total cost for a single unit would be $19.39. And if we multiply 
that by the quantity of 1000 units, it would cost a total of $19,394.
This would be the total for the manufacture of 1000 units, (excluding the arduino).

Review Question 2 (Health/Safety/Reliability)

Assume this system was to be sold to consumers for use at their home.

Considering reliability, health, and safety...

 - What scenarios might you suggest testing (considering both HW and SW) 
    before releasing the product for use? 

    In terms of software i woould consider location. While in the US we use Farheneit
    in other places they use Celcius. It would also be good to consider that 
    the EEPROM of our current circuit has a limit. While that limit is bound to be almsot
    impossible to be reached easily, it is still a cause of reliability to conider.
    For health, there doesnt seem to be anything wrong with it. I would say that 
    if this were distributed to the general public, the buzzer should continue to 
    buzz becuase there is the chance a user wont here the single and initial buzz of 
    warning. 




 - How might you make your design more reliable? By reliability we don't just
   mean keeping it running correctly (though you should consider that), but
   also how you can detect that a connected component has failed to gracefully
   handle such situations.  You can consider both HW and SW points of failure,
   issues related to the operational environment, etc. and how to mitigate
   those cases.

   In order to make it more reliable it might be a good idea to have backups.
   If a certian function or component were to fail that some the back should internally
   (SW) detect it and start making the back up function turn on. Another thing we 
   can do is to maybe if something fails that the LCD Shield error check itself and tell
   the user something has failed. I think another way of warning could be the buzzer or the LEDs
   used to indicate a problem with the board.
